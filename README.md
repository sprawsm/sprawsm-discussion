Sprawsm Design Discussion
=========================

An easy way to add Disqus comments to your mockups so that you can comment on it within the context of the mockup itself.

The idea for this *hack* came about when we got tired of discussing designs in disconnected apps, like Basecamp. We wanted our customers to be able to provide feedback while they are looking at the mockup itself. 

[Disqus][1] comments seemed like a perfect solutions to this as they are easily embeddable, and allow image attachments which are indispensable when you are trying to get your point across. 

Of course the use of this little widget isn't limited to design discussions. Feel free to use it however you see fit. 

How To Use 
----------

### 1. Set Up Disqus

First of all, you will need a [Disqus][1] account. We recommend opening a separate account tied to your company email. 

Next thing you need to do is to [register a site][2] with them, which basically means you are setting up the comments backend for the project you want to include the comments in. You only need to register one site, and you can use the same embed code on as many pages as you'd like. 

Feel free to name the site however you'd like, we usually go with “[project_name] Design Discussion”. This is totally irrelevant. 

Than you will get a chance to choose your site's Disqus URL, which is **very important** and you need to remember it. The Disqus folks also call it “site shortname”. 

You are also able to choose a category but that's largely irrelevant for this use case. 

At this point you are pretty much all set since all we really need is the site shortname, but let's check out some other settings of the newly created discussion site. 

In your Disqus site settings you will be able to adjust some settings to your liking, and we suggest you take notice of the following options (all in the General category): 

1. Set the **default sorting** to *newest first* 
2. *Uncheck* the **discovery** option (you probably don't want people finding your discussions randomly) 
3. *Check* the **guest commenting** so your customers don't neet to register for a Disqus account in order to comment on your mockups 
4. Make sure **media attachments** are *enabled*
